"""Present the live tree to the frozen H2.7-R0 custody validator.

The H3 custody addendum records the release-metadata transition 1.3.0 -> 1.4.0,
and its validator (hash-bound, never edited) requires the recorded 1.4.0 root
token. Later releases change only that token. This helper copies the custody
inputs and maps an approved later root version back to the recorded token, so
the validator still proves every other byte is unchanged. Any other version or
a duplicated root is left as-is and fails the validator.
