# Relations endpoint adjudication — coverage gate (SRC 1)

Verdict: **NO TIGHTEN confirmed for the reviewed-primary-qualified endpoint rule**;
relations-ledger review entries recorded for every offender row on 2026-09-22.

## Context

The [historical 2026-09-09 scope](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/blob/cd4a84cd91d884d6952b2b2f1b0289b2bdfd36ed/SCOPE-2026-09-09.md)
item SRC 1 proposed tightening the
theorem-witness endpoint check in
`src/fep_lean/catalogue/coverage.py:157-164`: instead of accepting any mention
of each endpoint's topic namespace, require a qualified reference to each
endpoint's reviewed primary theorem from
[config/theorem_maturity.yaml](../config/theorem_maturity.yaml). A prior dry-run
(recorded in the CHANGELOG verification-layer notes) found 89/125 edges failing
that strict rule, so the verdict was recorded as a relations-ledger review
rather than a code change. This record closes that review with per-site
evidence at commit `5b8650c`.

## Rule ladder, re-measured at 5b8650c

All 125 theorem-witnessed edges in
[config/formalism_relations.yaml](../config/formalism_relations.yaml) were
checked against each candidate rule over comment-stripped witness sources:

| Endpoint rule | Edges passing | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bare topic-namespace mention (gate as shipped) | 125/125 | current behavior |
| Review-namespace-qualified (`fep_fepNNN.FEPNNN.`) | 125/125 | viable, not adopted — see decision |
| Any reviewed theorem (primary ∪ supporting ∪ boundary) | 109/125 (16 fail, all `kind: formal`) | not adoptable without ledger re-authoring |
| Reviewed primary theorem only (the rule under adjudication) | 36/125 (**89 fail**) | **NO TIGHTEN confirmed** |

The strict rule therefore cannot be adopted without re-authoring 89 witness
rows; per the SCOPE decision rule the fix is a relations-ledger review, never a
code loosening. This lane reviewed the offender rows and recorded a review
entry on each; the gate code and every `witness` and `kind` are unchanged.

## Offender sites (measured, supersedes the stale 25-site count)

The offender sites group by topic as: fep-038×7, fep-009×4, fep-028×4,
fep-036×6, fep-049×3 — **24 call-sites** at `5b8650c`. (The earlier
f335724-era tally recorded 25 sites with fep-009×5, fep-028×5, fep-036×5; the
relation set shifted during the wave-D re-seal. The table below is measured at
this tip and is authoritative.)

Every site fails the strict rule only because the witness carries the relation
through the endpoint topic's reviewed *supporting* theorem (or, in one row,
through the topics' Fisher-metric definitions) rather than through the primary
theorem. Each row below now carries a dated `Reviewed 2026-09-22 against the
primary-qualified endpoint rule` entry in its `rationale` naming that evidence.

Three of the sixteen edges that also fail the weaker any-reviewed-theorem rule
fall inside these groups (row 1 on both sides; rows 17 and 22 on their
non-listed sides). Those
witnesses relate the topics through the topics' *definitions* — the composed
theorems construct and connect the endpoint objects directly (Fisher metric,
smoothed empirical rate, entropy production) without invoking any reviewed
theorem, which is theorem-structure evidence, not a spurious namespace mention.

## Decision

1. **No code change.** The strict reviewed-primary rule stays unimplemented;
   the shipped gate is untouched, and no projection-affecting loosening was
   made.
2. **Ledger review entries recorded.** Each of the 24 offender rows in
   [config/formalism_relations.yaml](../config/formalism_relations.yaml) now
   carries a dated review entry naming the reviewed supporting theorem (or
   definitions) that actually carries the relation, and stating that the row
   stands unchanged.
3. **Projections regenerated.** `docs/formalism-coverage.json`,
   `docs/formalism-coverage.md`, and `docs/formalism-atlas.*` were regenerated
   from the amended ledger and pass their `--check` gates.
4. **Follow-up for a future wave.** Satisfying the strict rule would require
   re-composing 89 witnesses to cite each endpoint's primary theorem — a
   Lean-authoring relations effort, deliberately not simulated here. The
   review-namespace-qualified tightening (125/125 green) remains available as
   a strictly stronger, non-breaking gate if that wave lands.

## LEAN-6 review: pairings whose witnesses are named like derivations (2026-10-08)

Issue #104 asked whether any `formal_pairing` edge whose witness name says
"specializes", "refines", "extends", or "bounds" is in fact a derivation that
should be tagged `formal`. The test applied is strict: re-tag only if the
witness statement consumes one endpoint's theorem and produces the other
endpoint's statement (or an exact instance of it). A witness that conjoins two
independently proved endpoint laws is a pairing, however it is named. This
section is maintained by hand; no generator writes it.

| Edge | Witness | Statement shape | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fep-089 → fep-006 | `FEPComposed.fep089_finite_jet_shift_specializes_fep006` | `shift (a+b) j = shift a (shift b j) ∧ iterateFlow (shift 1) (a+b) j = iterateFlow (shift 1) a (iterateFlow (shift 1) b j)` | Keep pairing. The second conjunct is fep-006's additivity at the one-degree shift, but nothing identifies `shift n` with the n-fold iterate of `shift 1`, so the native law is not used to obtain it. |
| fep-092 → fep-032 | `FEPComposed.fep092_quadratic_convergence_specializes_fep032` | `Tendsto (predictionError ∘ iteratePredictionUpdate) ∧ Tendsto (fep032_quadraticUpdate^[n] estimate) (nhds target)` | Keep pairing; tightened rationale proposed (released row is digest-sealed, so the YAML wording changes only with a reviewed seal delta). The old wording called the iterations "equivalent", which the witness does not prove. |
| fep-110 → fep-028 | `FEPComposed.fep110_product_of_experts_refines_fep028_normalization` | `∑ unitWeightProductOfExpertsPool = 1 ∧ ∑ fep028_softmax = 1` | Keep pairing. Two unrelated normalization laws; the rationale already disclaims identifying the weighting conventions. |
| fep-115 → fep-042 | `FEPComposed.fep115_frequency_union_bound_extends_fep042_counts` | `law.real (⋃ deviation events) ≤ card * failure ∧ fep042_bernoulliLikelihood = p^successes * (1-p)^failures` | Keep pairing; tightened rationale proposed (released row is digest-sealed, so the YAML wording changes only with a reviewed seal delta). The likelihood factorization does not consume the union bound. |
| fep-116 → fep-001 | `FEPComposed.fep116_pac_bayes_refines_fep001_variational_bound` | `E_posterior[pop] ≤ E_posterior[emp] + (KL + log(1/δ))/β ∧ surprisal ≤ fep001_variationalUpperBound ...` | Keep pairing; tightened rationale proposed (released row is digest-sealed, so the YAML wording changes only with a reviewed seal delta). The fep-001 conjunct is an independent instance, not a consequence of the finite PAC-Bayes bound. |
| fep-063 → fep-014 | `FEPComposed.fep063_channel_dpi_bounds_fep014` | `finiteKL (channel actual) (channel reference) ≤ finiteKL actual reference ∧ 0 ≤ klDiv nativeActual nativeReference` | Keep pairing; tightened rationale proposed (released row is digest-sealed, so the YAML wording changes only with a reviewed seal delta). The native measures are unrelated to the finite laws, so the second conjunct is not a bound on the first. |
| fep-054 → fep-017 | `FEPComposed.fep054_involution_of_fep017_posterior` | `(likelihood†prior)†(likelihood ∘ₘ prior) =ᵐ[prior] likelihood ∧ posterior ∘ₘ likelihood ∘ₘ prior = prior` | Keep pairing; tightened rationale proposed (released row is digest-sealed, so the YAML wording changes only with a reviewed seal delta). Each conjunct is its own topic's theorem; neither is derived from the other. |

Outcome: zero re-tags. The `formal` edge count is not raised by this review.
Every kept row now states in its `rationale` that it was reviewed on this date
and why it is not a derivation.

## LEAN-8 review: isolated topics (2026-10-08)

Issue #106 asked for the four topics with no or only conceptual relations.
Verified at the start of the review: fep-007, fep-046 and fep-050 had no edge
at all, and fep-029 had a single `conceptual` edge (to fep-044). No existing
composition or foundation theorem mentioned any of the four, so none could be
related by an existing qualified witness. Each now has a small new theorem in
an existing composition leaf, with an explicit scope statement in its
rationale.

| Topic | New edge | Witness (leaf) | What the theorem proves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fep-007 | fep-007 → fep-028 `formal` | `fep007_normalizedMessage_is_fep028_softmax` (`control_temporal`) | With unit incoming messages and factor `exp (-gamma * cost)`, the normalized message equals the support-aware softmax on the support embedded from `Fin 8` into `Fin 10`; fep-007's primary theorem then gives the softmax unit sum. |
| fep-029 | fep-029 → fep-104 `formal` (the conceptual fep-044 edge is kept) | `fep029_quadraticBregman_is_fep104_scalar_instance` (`thermo_geometry`) | The scalar quadratic Bregman divergence is the `d = 1` instance of the generic Bregman divergence, and fep-104's three-point identity gives the scalar three-point law. |
| fep-046 | fep-046 → fep-045 `formal` | `fep046_single_break_is_fep045_bernoulli` (`core`) | One break is the Bernoulli law of fep-045; fep-046's mass conservation derives the normalization of fep-045's posterior mass function. |
| fep-050 | fep-050 → fep-049 `formal` | `fep050_landauer_work_bound_from_fep049_entropy_production` (`thermo_geometry`) | With the explicit premise `totalEntropyChange = entropyProduction`, fep-049's nonnegativity discharges fep-050's second-law hypothesis and yields the Landauer work bound. |

Caveats recorded with the edges: the fep-050 → fep-049 premise is a modelling
assumption, not a consequence of either topic; the fep-007 → fep-028 identity
fixes the factor and incoming messages; the fep-046 → fep-045 identity covers
one break only. The relations schema has no "isolated by design" field, and none
was needed because every topic received a witnessed edge.
