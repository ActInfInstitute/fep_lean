## Reference

- [Documentation specification](SPEC.md) — what the documentation set must cover and how it is kept self-contained.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) — package layout and the data flow between catalogue, Lean, Hermes, and OpenGauss.
- [Python API](api.md) — public package surface.
- [Formalism authorship guide](authorship-guide.md) — strengthening a reviewed topic and deciding when a new formalism is warranted.
- [Branch coverage](coverage-branch.md) — the declared coverage configuration and what the gate measures.

- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) — preflight, setup, and run failures with their remedies.

## Historical reviews

Dated snapshots and adjudications. Counts and verdicts reflect the date they
were written; current evidence lives in the generated reports above.

- [Mahakala adversarial review](mahakala-review.md) — 2026-07-31 external-style review of the repository.
- [Test suite review](test-suite-review.md) — 2026-07-31 snapshot of suite structure and gaps.
- [Relations endpoint adjudication](relations-endpoint-adjudication.md) — coverage-gate verdict on the reviewed-primary-qualified endpoint rule.

All paths in this directory resolve within this repository. Catalogue-derived
manuscript inputs are created by `uv run fep-lean catalogue`; coverage, atlas,
dashboard, and manuscript-render checks each retain a separate freshness gate.

The [repository execution contract](../AGENTS.md) owns the required checks.
[`.python-version`](../.python-version) selects Python 3.14 for validation;
[`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml) defines the packaging floor and the 89%
line-coverage gate. The package floor does not expand validator acceptance.
Current open acceptance work is recorded in [`TODO.md`](../TODO.md).
