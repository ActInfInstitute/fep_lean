# Lean 4 workspace

The workspace pins `leanprover/lean4:v4.34.1` and the matching Mathlib
`v4.34.1` release, with `lean/lake-manifest.json` recording the exact Mathlib
revision those pins resolve to. These are exact reproducibility pins for the
newest stable Lean/Mathlib release pair, not floating aliases: release
candidates and nightlies do not replace the stable line. The networked pin
audit re-derives the newest valid pair from the live ecosystem against that
manifest: it checks Lean's stable releases in descending order and accepts
only the newest release with a validated matching Mathlib tag, so the audited
pins stay in step with what the workspace actually builds with. A newer Lean
release without that tag is reported as pending ecosystem support rather
than installed into an incompatible workspace.

The [v4.34.1 release notes](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/releases/v4.34.1/)
describe the newest feature-bearing stable release. The workspace follows it
because Lean and the matching
[Mathlib4 v4.34.1 release](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/releases/tag/v4.34.1)
are both available. A documentation page lag never justifies downgrading an
installed, verified stable release.

```bash
uv run fep-lean setup
uv run python docs/pin_audit.py --check-latest
uv run fep-lean verify --fail-on-warnings --receipt output/native-verification.json
uv run python scripts/audit_formalisms.py --receipt output/formalism-audit.json
cd lean
lake build
lake build FepSketches
```

## Lock-preserving setup

From a checkout synchronized with `uv sync --locked --extra dev`, use
`uv run --locked fep-lean setup` or
`bash scripts/_maint_bootstrap_lean_toolchain.sh`. Both use the same bounded
implementation. It validates the toolchain, Mathlib tag, and committed
manifest before acquisition, and checks that the pin triple and `uv.lock`
remain byte-identical after each subprocess. An explicit Lake executable
must report the pinned compiler version. Without Lake, setup uses elan to
install exactly the checkout's toolchain; set `FEP_LEAN_ELAN_EXE` if elan is
not on PATH. `ELAN_HOME` may point to a new empty directory. Set
`XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `MATHLIB_CACHE_DIR` to isolate downloaded cache artifacts
as well; setup forwards these locations to its acquisition subprocesses.

The underlying acquisition sequence is:

```bash
elan toolchain install "$(cat lean/lean-toolchain)"
cd lean
lake exe cache get
lake build FepSketches
```

Pinned Lake reads existing manifest revisions for these commands. It has no
uv-style `--locked` option. The guarded setup entry points are preferred over
running the commands by hand: Lake can generate a missing manifest, so setup
rejects missing/corrupt pins before Lake runs. It never invokes `lake update`
or ignores a failed cache acquisition. The setup deadline covers installation,
cache acquisition, and build together; timeout kills the subprocess group.
A cache failure is a failure, not authorization for an unbudgeted source build.

On a pin error, inspect `git diff -- lean/lean-toolchain lean/lakefile.lean
lean/lake-manifest.json uv.lock`. Preserve intentional edits, then restore
these files together from the intended reviewed commit and rerun setup. Do
not repair ordinary setup with `lake update`. If a consistent reviewed pin
set still fails, retain the command log and diagnose the acquisition/toolchain
failure before changing dependencies. Setup reports unexpected pin drift
and stops; it does not overwrite user changes to hide drift.

### Repeatability check

In a clean disposable checkout after `uv sync --locked --extra dev`, isolate
the toolchain and artifact cache, then compare SHA-256 hashes across both
entry points. Elan must already be installed as described above.

```bash
export ELAN_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
uv run --locked python - <<'PYTHON'
import hashlib
from pathlib import Path
import subprocess

pins = ["lean/lean-toolchain", "lean/lakefile.lean", "lean/lake-manifest.json", "uv.lock"]
def hashes():
    return {name: hashlib.sha256(Path(name).read_bytes()).hexdigest() for name in pins}

before = hashes()
print("before:", before, flush=True)
for command in (["uv", "run", "--locked", "fep-lean", "setup"],
                ["bash", "scripts/_maint_bootstrap_lean_toolchain.sh"]):
    subprocess.run(command, check=True)
    after = hashes()
    print("after:", after, flush=True)
    assert after == before, "setup changed a checked-in pin"
subprocess.run(["git", "diff", "--exit-code", "--", *pins], check=True)
PYTHON
uv run --locked fep-lean verify --topic fep-001 --fail-on-warnings
(cd lean && lake env lean --version && git -C .lake/packages/mathlib rev-parse HEAD)
```

Retain the command output and elapsed times as separate Linux and macOS
receipts. A platform result covers the tested architecture and filesystem;
for container acceptance, use a native container filesystem for the checkout,
ELAN_HOME, and cache to avoid shared-filesystem file-handle limits during
parallel Lean compilation. One platform's result does not establish the
other's. This smoke does not replace full native receipt validation.

## Deliberate toolchain upgrades

When a newer compatible stable pair appears, update both canonical pins, run
`lake update` and the Mathlib cache acquisition, migrate every warning or
compiler error in canonical sources, and regenerate the native and formalism
receipts. CI and the scheduled latest-stable workflow reject a stale compatible
pair; they do not silently select a different compiler.

Canonical topic bodies live in family modules under
[`src/fep_lean/catalogue/bodies/`](../src/fep_lean/catalogue/bodies/).
[`registry.py`](../src/fep_lean/catalogue/registry.py) validates and merges them,
and [`latex.py`](../src/fep_lean/catalogue/latex.py) projects theorem signatures.
The tracked aggregate
[`lean/FepSketches/fep_all.lean`](../lean/FepSketches/fep_all.lean) is regenerated with
[`scripts/_maint_build_fep_all_lean.py`](../scripts/_maint_build_fep_all_lean.py).
CI rejects regeneration drift, proof holes, and Lean warnings in the aggregate.

Reusable foundations and cross-topic theorems have separate canonical owners
under [`src/fep_lean/formal/`](../src/fep_lean/formal/); the exact module set
and roles are declared in `manifest.py`. Leaf modules under `compositions/` own
proofs that consume multiple stable topic namespaces, while `composed.lean` is
their import-only aggregate.
[`scripts/_maint_build_formal_modules.py`](../scripts/_maint_build_formal_modules.py)
projects every manifested Lean source byte-for-byte into `lean/FepSketches/`.
For a dependency-ordered navigation map of the formal modules, see
[`lean-landscape.md`](lean-landscape.md), generated by
[`scripts/_maint_build_lean_landscape.py`](../scripts/_maint_build_lean_landscape.py)
(with a `--check` freshness gate).
Formal
relations in `config/formalism_relations.yaml` must name a qualified declaration
from this or another canonical module. The formalism audit resolves all primary
and semantic-evidence declarations and runs `#print axioms` over every one. A
zero exit code is insufficient: the receipt requires one parsed axiom result
per declaration, normalizes hard-wrapped Lean messages, binds actual Lean and
the resolved Mathlib revision, and rejects missing output, stale projections,
warnings, `sorryAx`, or axioms outside the versioned trusted set (`propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).

The [formal-kernel methods](formal-kernel-methods.md) page explains the
probability, information, active-inference, blanket, geometry, and convergence
contracts and why projection, build, audit, native receipt, visualization, and
full-run evidence remain distinct.

## Catalogue source of truth {#catalogue-source-of-truth}

Metadata, semantic review, novelty records, and the family body registry are
maintained separately and joined strictly by the schema-2 roster seal.
`config/topics.yaml` and packaged `src/fep_lean/data/topics.yaml` must be
byte-identical. The strict loader checks the generated schema before execution.

## Cursor Lean 4 commands {#cursor-lean4-commands}

Use the canonical local commands above. Editor integrations should invoke the
same pinned Lake workspace rather than a separately discovered compiler.

## Mathlib4 modules used in fep_lean {#mathlib4-modules-used-in-fep_lean}

Each canonical body declares the narrow Mathlib modules it needs; the generated
coverage map records distinct modules and topic-to-import edges. The metadata
`mathlib` field is a navigation hint and is not accepted as import evidence.

`LeanVerifier` writes only transient `_verify_*.lean` files beneath
`lean/FepSketches/`; these are removed after each compilation.

## Gaussian conditioning against Mathlib {#gaussian-conditioning-gap-memo}

Gap memo for LEAN-14, probed against the pinned Mathlib under
`lean/.lake/packages/mathlib`. Verdict: the algebraic (precision and
covariance) route is feasible and is implemented in
`gaussian_precision_conditioning.lean`; the generic measure-level conditional
statement is a Mathlib gap.

| Need | Status in pinned Mathlib |
| --- | --- |
| Multivariate Gaussian law `multivariateGaussian μ S`, covariance entries, marginal restriction | Present (`Gaussian/Multivariate.lean`) |
| Uncorrelated jointly Gaussian coordinates are independent | Present (`HasGaussianLaw/Independence.lean`), unconditional only |
| Block inverses, `det_fromBlocks₁₁/₂₂`, `invOf_fromBlocks₁₁_eq/₂₂_eq`, `inv_fromBlocks_zero₂₁_of_isUnit_iff` | Present (`SchurComplement.lean`) |
| `PosSemidef.fromBlocks₁₁/₂₂` (positivity iff Schur complement) | Present (`PosDef.lean`), semidefinite only |
| Principal submatrix and inverse of a `PosDef` matrix are `PosDef` | Present (`PosDef.submatrix`, `PosDef.inv`) |
| `condIndepFun` and `condDistrib` characterisations | Present (`Independence/Conditional.lean`) |
| Schur complement of the inverse equals inverse of the principal block (`Σ_xx - Σ_xb Σ_bb⁻¹ Σ_bx = (K_xx)⁻¹`) | Missing; proved here, about 40 lines |
| Gaussian conditional kernel (`condDistrib` of a Gaussian given a coordinate block is Gaussian with Schur-complement covariance) | Missing; estimate several hundred lines (disintegration plus affine-shift decomposition) |
| Gaussian conditional independence from block-sparse precision | Missing; follows from the previous row, same size class |
| Block-diagonal covariance of a Gaussian gives independence of blocks (vector-valued) | Partly present (`diagonalStrongDualProd`); not stated for conditionals |

FORM-S14 therefore proves the dimension-generic statement at the algebraic
level (conditional precision is the interior principal block, conditional
covariance is its inverse, and its external--internal cross block vanishes
exactly when `K_{ei} = 0`), recovers the fixed Fin4 theorem as an instance next
to the existing measure-level `external_condIndep_internal_given_blanket`, and
supplies a non-sparse countermodel. The measure-level generic theorem waits on
the Gaussian conditional kernel rows above.
