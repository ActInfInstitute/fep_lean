# Scripts contract

Public execution belongs to `src/fep_lean/cli.py` and the `fep-lean` console entry
point. Script files may only provide thin wrappers or deterministic maintenance
operations; they must not import packages outside this checkout.

`setup_checkout.sh` composes the portable checkout kit: locked dev dependency
installation at `.python-version`, environment checks, two guarded setup
passes, then catalogue and figure materialization. Its `--catalogue-only`
tier omits Lean and rasterization. Keep pin validation, cache-miss rejection,
and deadline enforcement in `fep-lean setup`; do not duplicate that policy in
the shell wrapper. The kit prepares local gates but does not refresh custody,
native, or render receipts. Publication rendering and external full-mode
services remain separate tiers in [getting started](../docs/getting-started.md).
See the [off-host inventory](../docs/scaffold-portability.md) for substitutions
and isolated acceptance. Preserve the ordering and acceptance boundaries in
the [render runbook](README.md#local-render-runbook).

Canonical authoring lives outside this wrapper directory: family-owned modules
under `src/fep_lean/catalogue/bodies/`, the validated catalogue registry,
`config/catalogue_metadata.yaml`, `config/theorem_maturity.yaml`,
`config/formalism_novelty.yaml`, and `config/formalism_relations.yaml`.
`_maint_build_topics_catalogue.py`,
`_maint_build_fep_all_lean.py`, `_maint_build_formal_modules.py`,
`build_formalism_coverage.py`, `build_formalism_atlas.py`, and
`build_formal_kernel_dashboard.py` are thin deterministic projection commands.
`audit_formalisms.py` is the native
declaration/axiom evidence adapter. The
`theorem_maturity_audit.py` maintenance command validates that review and
renders `docs/theorem-maturity-audit.md`.

`render_publication.py` is the publication entry point and owns the render
boundary: it renders the authored sources into `output/manuscript/` (the
directory the shared template actually typesets), runs the template's PDF
stage, and then runs `check_render_log.py`, exiting on the conjunction. The
template's own success test looks for four fatal markers under
`-interaction=nonstopmode`, so it reports success over a log recording TeX
errors and dropped glyphs; that template is a separate repository and this
wrapper does not accept its verdict. `build_render_fonts.py` owns the derived
font requirement (`docs/render-fonts.json`, `--check` in CI) and the host
probe. None of the three reconstructs a roster or a policy: the acceptance
predicates live in `fep_lean.output.render_log`, the requirement in
`fep_lean.output.render_fonts`.

A clean acceptance writes `docs/render-acceptance.json`, and CI runs
`check_render_log.py --verify-receipt` against it -- both after a real
end-to-end render in the `render` job, and between renders on the committed
receipt alone. The committed receipt is the gate that keeps a source change
edited without a fresh render from merging.

The receipt is bound to a digest over every typeset manuscript source plus
`manuscript/preamble.md`, so a chapter or a font selection changed without a
fresh render fails CI. The digest binds the byte-exact generated appendix too
(e.g. `09z_unified_formalism_catalogue.md`), so a `src/` count change that
regenerates it via `fep-lean catalogue` moves the digest and stales the
receipt; `manuscript_projection_drift` and `stale_render_defects` own the
placeholder-resolution surface and both run on the render path. A rejected
render writes no receipt and
removes the standing one -- sources can drift out of a render without changing,
so the digest alone would let a superseded receipt keep vouching. The digests
are recorded per file, so a stale receipt names what moved.

`build_release_bundle.py` is a thin public wrapper over
`fep_lean.output.release_bundle`. It never reconstructs the archive roster,
renderer policy, manifest, checksum table, or evidence boundaries. `--check`
must remain non-mutating and bind an existing archive back to current sources.
Generated Lean output is tracked and must be regeneration-identical. The formal
resource manifest owns foundation, leaf-composition, and import-aggregate
projections; wrapper scripts must not reconstruct that roster independently.

`build_manuscript_figures.py` publishes the atlas/dashboard PNGs (rasterized
from the committed SVG projections) and the authored graphical-abstract asset
the manuscript cites, copying each into `output/figures/`; `--check` fails
when a cited PNG is missing or older than its source. The write pass must
precede the check on a fresh checkout because `output/` is gitignored; CI
runs exactly that pair after `fep-lean catalogue`. It reconstructs no roster:
the cited-figure map lives in `fep_lean.output.svg_raster`.

`build_graphical_abstract.py` is the graphical abstract's producer (thin
wrapper over `fep_lean.output.graphical_abstract`): it regenerates the
sha256-pinned canonical asset `manuscript/assets/graphical-abstract.png`
byte-deterministically as an 8-bit non-interlaced RGB PNG, and `--check`
validates the committed asset against its config pin without writing. A new
digest must be recorded in `manuscript/config.yaml` in the same change; the
validator fails closed on any mismatch. Never hand-edit the PNG or let any
other tool write it: the pinned digest must keep describing pixels this
producer generated.

`verify_report_receipt.py` is a thin wrapper over
`fep_lean.output.reporter.validate_report_receipt`: it recomputes a report
bundle's artifact hashes, reconciles the summary, run, and verification
manifests, and compares stored digests with a live checkout.
`--require-complete` additionally demands a complete, non-empty, zero-warning
full-mode receipt. It never reruns the pipeline.

`release_check.py` is the whole release gate: one version/date across every
version-bearing file, a dated `CHANGELOG.md` section, and (`--hosted`) a clean
`HEAD` equal to `origin/main` with a successful hosted `ci.yml` run on that
exact commit. `--notes` writes the changelog section as release notes. See
[docs/release.md](../docs/release.md).

`capture_browser_acceptance.py` is a thin wrapper over
`fep_lean.output.browser_capture.capture_browser_acceptance`: it records the
canonical Chrome/CDP acceptance receipt plus six bound screenshots under
`output/`. It needs a local browser and is not part of CI; the receipt it
writes is what `fep_lean.output.release_bundle` validation consumes.

The local verify cache-reuse path lives slice-locally under
`specs/ci-velocity-local-cache/` (not a `scripts/` wrapper, deliberately
roster-excluded). It stores only derived Lake build outputs, validates the
pin triple before Lake, and rejects a Mathlib cache 404-warning-with-zero-exit
per the W4-PORTABLE-CHECKOUT findings.
