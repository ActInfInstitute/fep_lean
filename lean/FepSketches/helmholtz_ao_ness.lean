# Helmholtz–Ao nonequilibrium steady-state decomposition

Finite-state incarnation of the Helmholtz–Ao potential-and-solenoidal split
of a nonequilibrium steady state (the manuscript section
`04d_framework_thermodynamics.md`, `sec:thermo_ness_fokker_planck`): the
drift ansatz `f = -(D + Q) ∇F` with `F = -log p*` and `Qᵀ = -Q` becomes, on
a finite state space with full-support stationary law `p*`, a decomposition
of a rate field into a reversible (detailed-balance) part plus a circulation
part relative to `p*`, together with the explicit divergence check
`∑ j, current j i = 0` that the manuscript demands of the ansatz.

## Main results

| theorem | meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `skewQuadratic_eq_zero` | a skew-symmetric matrix annihilates its quadratic form `gᵀ Q g = 0` (the quadratic-term cancellation) |
| `skewTrace_eq_zero` | `tr(Q H) = 0` for skew `Q` and symmetric `H`; `H` plays the Hessian role (the trace-term cancellation) |
| `aoDecomposition` | every rate field splits, relative to a full-support law, into `symmetricPart + circulationPart` (the finite `D + Q` ansatz) |
| `circulationPart_skew` | the circulation part is skew in the `p*`-weighted sense `p*_i Q_ij = -p*_j Q_ji` (the `Qᵀ = -Q` clause) |
| `symmetricPart_reversible` | the symmetric part is reversible: `p*_i D_ij = p*_j D_ji` |
| `forceSplit` | the log-affinity splits into potential drop plus skew force: `log(p*_i W_ij / p*_j W_ji) = (F_j - F_i) + log(W_ij / W_ji)` |
| `current_eq_twice_circulation` | the stationary edge current is carried entirely by the circulation part: `J_ij = 2 p*_i Q_ij` |
| `symmetricPart_current_eq_zero` | the reversible part carries no current at all |
| `detailedBalanced_iff_circulation_eq_zero` | removing the circulation part is exactly detailed balance |
| `stationaryCurrent_divergence_zero` | under the generator contract (row sums zero) and stationarity, the node divergence of the stationary current vanishes: `∑ j, J_ji = 0` |
| `cycle_*` | the directed three-cycle witness: stationary and divergence-free with `circulationPart = 1/2 ≠ 0` and current `1/3 ≠ 0` — a genuine NESS whose entire current is circulation |

## Scope discipline

* Finite carrier only: states form a `Fintype`, the potential is the
  pointwise `F = -log p*` on masses, and every derivative of the manuscript
  section is replaced by an explicit finite algebraic hypothesis.  The
  continuum Fokker–Planck equation, the diffusion matrix field, and the SDE
  noise are not formalized here.
* The Ao potential `aoPotential` is deliberately distinct from the
  thermodynamic `U - T S` Helmholtz free energy of the `fep013` topic; the
  manuscript keeps the two objects separate.
* The skew-algebra section is parameterized by an arbitrary dimension
  `Fin n`.  The steady-state sections reuse the repository's
  `FEP.ContinuousTimeMarkov` generator contract, so stationarity, detailed
  balance, and the probability current keep their established meanings.
* Carriers stay finite and every hypothesis is explicit.  No new axioms,
  no proof placeholders, no `native_decide`.
* This file is standalone: it is not wired into the generated
  `fep_all.lean`; the catalogue wire-up (topic row, formal-resource roster
  entry, aggregate hoist) is a post-acceptance coordinator chore.
