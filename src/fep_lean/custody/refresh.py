"""The one sanctioned custody-refresh command, composing the settled phases.

``refresh`` composes the already-verified custody machinery in its
dependency-safe order and adds nothing new:

1. :func:`fep_lean.custody.census.census` — the read-only drift census.
2. :func:`fep_lean.custody.verify.verify` — the strict stop-gate against
   ``GATE_EXPECTATIONS``. A ``live-red`` record is never authorized; stale
   surfaces outside ``authorized_changes`` fail; a required surface missing
   from the census fails.
3. :func:`fep_lean.custody.apply.apply_refresh` — the settled 14-phase walk,
   writing only into the explicit staging tree.
4. The read-only verify set: the readiness matrix contract, the R0 custody
   successor validator, the terminal-acceptance validator, the diagnostics
   byte-equality probe, the custody test suites, the formalism audit
   receipt, and the pin audit.
5. The pre-capture owner gate: :func:`fep_lean.output.provenance.report_owner_errors`
   must return zero errors and the tip must be committed-clean before any
   native capture runs.
6. Optionally, the native Lean capture — fail-closed on every boundary: the
   subprocess exit code, post-capture rechecks (dirty tree, moved HEAD,
   owner drift), receipt presence, and an independent
   :func:`fep_lean.output.evidence.validate_native_lean_receipt` binding of
   the receipt to the live tree. A refresh report with a captured ``native``
   dict therefore implies a claim-ready receipt.

The known post-apply bridge cascade (source_binding FAILED naming an
authorized owner, freshness STALE) is reported as a warning with the
post-fold pin-cycle direction; it is never a failure and never remedied
here — pin cycles are coordinator-side.

Two orchestration modes reuse these gates and the same apply machinery
without ever running the verify-set subprocesses:

- :func:`plan_refresh` (``--plan``) — a read-only planning pass: reason,
  directories, dirty tip, HEAD, owner inventory, census, the mode verify
  gate (``GATE_EXPECTATIONS`` requireds plus the chore's ``--authorized``
  staleness set), the authorized-path roster check, and a direct
  matrix.yaml-toolchain-vs-lean-toolchain pin check. It writes the evidence
  journal and stops in state ``planned``.
- :func:`fixpoint_refresh` (``--fixpoint``) — the bounded staged fixpoint:
  round 1 stages from ``specs_dir``; every later round stages the previous
  round's flushed tree with the prior rounds' directive projections seeded
  into the walk. Convergence requires zero mutations, zero directives, and
  a byte-identical re-application into a throwaway directory; a repeated
  non-terminal state hash is a cycle and the round bound refuses. Terminal
  state ``awaiting-commit``; the staged candidate is the final round's
  flushed tree.

``--resume <journal-dir>`` validates a committed candidate, enforces current
render acceptance, and completes the verify set and optional native capture.
Journals are schema-1 JSON files landed atomically under
``output/custody-journal/<operation-id>/`` (``--journal-dir`` overrides the
parent); ``--reason`` stays mandatory in every mode. Receipt re-issues the
fixpoint performs are dependency re-binds, not new execution evidence —
sealed historical observations are preserved.
