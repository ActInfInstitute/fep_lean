# `fep_lean.methods`

Portable, offline mathematical positioning of the FEP Formal catalogue. The
package validates the canonical topic, maturity, relation, and positioning
inputs, then answers exact queries and renders deterministic artifacts: a JSON
and Markdown projection, a visual model, SVG panels, and a self-contained
`mathematical-map.html`.

```text
installed data or explicit checkout → validated MathematicalPositioning
                                    → queries (CLI / API)
                                    → positioning.json / .md, visual-model.json,
                                      mathematical-map.html, panels/*.svg
```

`build_mathematical_positioning(project_root=None)` uses the installed package
data; passing a checkout root reads the canonical owners instead. The result
records its `SourceOrigin` and the SHA-256 of every byte read. Queries
(`inspect_topic`, `inspect_family`, `inspect_theorem`, `analyze_topic`,
`positioning_neighbors`, `cross_corpus_embedding`) return detached copies.

Use `uv run fep-lean methods --help`. `inspect`, `neighbors`, `probe`,
`analyze`, `theorem`, `embedding`, and `check` perform no writes; `export`
writes the artifact tree under `--output-root` (default
`output/mathematical-methods`). Failures print a JSON error and exit 1.

`probes.py` holds four finite diagnostic examples (Bernoulli Fisher interior,
KL support boundary, Fisher chart degeneracy, descent without identification)
and a deterministic two-dimensional classical MDS over binary feature vectors,
computed in 80-digit `Decimal` arithmetic so artifact bytes do not depend on
LAPACK or platform libm.

Everything here is explanatory context, not proof. Source validation is text
analysis, not Lean elaboration; family domains are editorial unions; feature
distance and MDS coordinates compare authored assignments and create no
theorem relation. No native receipt, Hermes/OpenGauss execution, or upstream
code execution is involved.

```python
from fep_lean.methods import build_mathematical_positioning, inspect_topic

model = build_mathematical_positioning()
print(inspect_topic(model, "fep-038")["primary_theorem_qualified"])
```
