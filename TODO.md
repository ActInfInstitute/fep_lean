# fep_lean — canonical open backlog

Rescoped on 2026-10-06. Only open work belongs here; completed delivery and
dated acceptance belong in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and retained history.
Each linked GitHub Issue contains its owner, detailed scope, dependencies,
positive acceptance, failure controls and claim boundary. Size means
implementation scope, not a version or schedule promise.

## Release gate

Releases follow the short [release procedure](docs/release.md): one version
and date across version-bearing files, a dated changelog section, and a
successful hosted `ci.yml` run on the exact `main` commit, all checked by
`docs/release_check.py`. The untagged `1.4.0` candidate shipped in
`v1.5.0` (2026-10-06). Nothing below blocks a release.

## Evidence and research lanes

These keep their own acceptance probes and are reported in release notes, not
claimed. Hosted Chrome startup (CUR-01) passed its eight required cases on the
[accepted exact-source PR run](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/actions/runs/37682721329).
Fresh full capture and the closed production DOM rejection (CUR-15) retain
their own acceptance gates. H3 primary seeds remain unopened; Q7
generated-runner execution remains unverified. The
[locked protocol](specs/comprehensive-science-improvement/PROTOCOL.md) retains
all nine original criteria; the [execution sequence](specs/comprehensive-science-improvement/NEXT.md)
orders this work.

## Separately governed lanes

These remain open and activate only on their stated conditions.
A governed empirical no-go satisfies the frozen current program. Accepted Q7
static proofs do not imply the future runner lane ran. PRs remain substantive
until a verified integration or disposition; they are not removed as legacy.

## Upcoming minor, medium and major scopes

The [maintained research scopes](docs/design/fep-research-program/next-improvements.md)
retain the eleven existing detailed proposals; the additional bounded issues
cover configuration, accessibility, catalogue review and general finite duality.
Use the [work-package contract](docs/design/fep-research-program/research-contract.md)
before activating an implementation. Demonstrate a concrete gap first for
configuration and visualization work. New owners require a coordinated source
roster refresh; new topics are not implicitly reserved by this plan.

## Scoped improvements (2026-10-08)

Filed from [SCOPE-2026-10-08.md](SCOPE-2026-10-08.md). Formalism rows are
strengthening briefs that feed [FORM-D3](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/75); none promotes a
disposition without independent semantic review. Rows marked by their
Issue as roster-bound wait for a coordinated provenance-roster refresh.

### Formalism strengthening

| [FORM-S5](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/88) — Landauer bound for biased bits from path-space fluctuation theorems (fep-050) | Medium | [FORM-S4](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/87), [FORM-S6](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/89), [FORM-D3](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/75) | No second-law hypothesis remains; a biased-bit witness; equality at a reversible protocol. |

| [FORM-S12](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/95) — Dirichlet–categorical learning of A and B matrices | Medium | [FORM-D3](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/75) | Stage 1: `K = 2` reproduces fep-045 exactly, `α = 1` reproduces fep-121 smoothing, exchangeability theorem, learned kernel rows stay normalised. |

| Work | Size | Predecessors | Closure probe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [DOC-4](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/140) — Tokenise the remaining manuscript count and audit root-doc counts | Medium | Independent | Changing a catalogue count in README fails the audit; `render_manuscript.py --check` passes. |
| [DOC-7](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/143) — Move dated scope baselines out of the root | Minor | Independent | No stale path to either file; strict link check passes. |
| [DOC-8](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/144) — Clarify the '155' catalogue chapter beside a 168-topic catalogue | Minor | Independent | `xref_audit`, `render_manuscript --check` and the landscape `--check` pass. |
| [DOC-11](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/146) — One owner per topic across README, AGENTS, HANDOFF and SPEC | Major | [CORE-M2](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/63), [DOC-1](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/fep_formal/issues/138) | Each gate command defined once; README shorter; markdown gates pass. |

## Original requirement coverage and closure

| Original criterion | Required open gates |
| --- | --- |
| 1 — truthful static status | CUR-06, CUR-14 |
| 2 — actual package support | CUR-06, CUR-07 |
| 3 — docs and accepted render | CUR-07 |
| 4 — strict capture/archive parity | CUR-03, CUR-05 |
| 5 — information identity/coarsening | CUR-07, CUR-14 |
| 6 — relative-support/native information | CUR-07, CUR-14 |
| 7 — genuine finite rate-distortion | CUR-07, CUR-14 |
| 8 — frozen H3 full chain | CUR-08, CUR-09, CUR-10 |
| 9 — all checks/source/remote evidence | CUR-07, CUR-14 |

An item leaves TODO and its Issue closes only after its own exact-current-source
acceptance is retained and recorded in changelog/release notes or accepted
history. Missing, historical, partial or indirect evidence keeps it open.
Scientific null/rejection/no-go outcomes remain evidence under their protocol;
they do not authorize retries, changed gates or unsupported success claims.
Source-only approval, installation, local runtime, hosted acceptance and live
publication are separate states. Never close a broad requirement on a subset.
