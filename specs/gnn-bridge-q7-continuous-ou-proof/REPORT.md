# Q7: scalar OU coefficient bounds

The isolated native captures and postcapture observations below are accepted
only for their recorded 2026-10-02 source epochs. The dated
[post-guidance observation](../comprehensive-science-improvement/evidence/public-q7-current-doc-20261002-r1/summary.json)
records three passing read-only checks with stable custody at that epoch.
Existing-owner repairs reopen `FEP-Q7-CURRENT` in [TODO.md](../../TODO.md);
[remaining acceptance](../comprehensive-science-improvement/NEXT.md) owns fresh
source-pair validation. A later incomplete capture supplies no current
acceptance or promoted native result. The original 2026-09-04 report and
[historical native JSON](native_receipt.json) retain their scope and bytes.
No Q5/Q6 observation is refreshed by a Q7 proof.

## Claim and scope

The decoded binary64 coefficients of the canonical scalar-OU JAX render have exact-real error bounds of 10^-15 against the selected OU formulas. The proof also bounds one-step prediction and stationary defects and proves a scalar Joseph identity.

These are real-arithmetic bounds over decoded coefficients. They do not bound JAX arithmetic, accumulated trajectory error, arbitrary LGSSMs, SDE solutions, or empirical behavior.

## Retained evidence

- The [public Q7 observation](../comprehensive-science-improvement/evidence/public-q7-closure-20261002-r1/summary.json) records accepted recapture r3 at actual receipt SHA-256 `8c7c8d89023eb9784405143c1750b4b7ddd4ff1453dbbd089e9d660633b912ad` and elapsed time 644.5096 seconds. Seven actual accepted substages from failed r2 are freshly revalidated; stages 8–12 actually run in r3. All 124 pure controls pass, zero skips.
- [Exact new native receipt copy](../comprehensive-science-improvement/evidence/q7-accepted-native-retention-20261002-r1/native-receipt.json) has SHA-256 `b0ecf640fffa06f019d67c74a2d02e22715120165a98d218d61f49f98366bc3b`, `native_claim_ready: true` and `runtime_execution_verified: false`. It binds Lean/Mathlib v4.34.1 and the selected isolated GNN source pair.
- The same public observation records actual postcapture closure r2 at receipt SHA-256 `df7787a925bf1011a9bd09a8bcc5ae20240792ea0b4ca9bc435eb5204225ba59` and elapsed time 1,648.1618 seconds. Seven stages pass, including actual positive-axiom/wrong-F/wrong-Q native controls. The local outer observation records actual exit 0 and accepted transport at SHA-256 `3f69a197c00fd4960270db9bb8547bd1fd20b39172fa3efd7ff4b3e36ad15712`; the process is closed. This observer is a separate evidence plane from the native receipt.
- [Render provenance](render_provenance.json) is the mutable working projection. Current acceptance requires a fresh complete source-pair capture; its current bytes do not stand in for the historical accepted render.
- [Generated proof manifest](generated/artifact_proof_manifest.json) is the mutable extraction/probe projection. It supplies no native or current capture acceptance by itself.
- At the recorded accepted epoch, the positive probe compiled without warnings or `sorryAx`; all 12 named theorem reports used only standard axioms. These are static coefficient statements; generated-runner execution remains unverified.
- Historical native JSON also binds its recorded contract, engine, Python/probe buffers, recursive imports, compiler binaries and transcripts at its earlier source epoch.
- Dated reported historical receipt SHA-256: `70f6e8b267c44189aa41e6b2adf3e777ad4ed51f60dfc8500e70c2110417c4a5`.
- Actual historical JSON SHA-256, read on 2026-10-02: `ba6df64c4515c2ac503d9a4f841b361766ed03039530f754f42108c0c593c8a2`. That file records historical compiler version `v4.33.1` and is not rewritten to match the earlier report or new receipt.

The recorded isolated GNN pair owns its Git checkout and copied runtime, with all 703
owners bound to `536d949829f6aed11dc540e5c5dec77578b25016` and a read-only
shared dependency base. FEP/native brackets cover 191/291 owners. Active GNN
work/output remain untouched by this isolated capture. Refreshed parity records
56,968 identical scaffold bytes on actual CPython 3.10.20, 3.11.15, 3.12.13,
3.13.15 and 3.14.4 at SHA-256
`b34a350a0c66bd611c19cd87e2343592c6ee7d15ed2fd6e422b1f891597febec`,
with all 11 controls per runtime. Strict evidence validation remains CPython 3.14.
Full operator-custody records remain local. The public summary is observational;
only the separately validated official native receipt supplies the native claim.

## Regression evidence

At the dated wave-2 epoch, Q6 passed both positive probes and the normalized previous/action-axis rejection.
Q7 passed its positive 12-theorem census and both wrong-coefficient rejections.
Its initial notation-scope and tactic-linter defects were repaired without
changing theorem statements, bounds, or warning policy. The independent read-only
review confirmed that scope and the repair. Q5's native regressions passed in
the frozen full baseline; its schema-2 receipt was then freshly compiled.

That historical integrated nonserial Python suite passed 1,460 tests with seven skips,
529 native deselections, and 89.83% coverage. See the
[coordinated wave-2 report](../gnn-bridge-w2-source-custody/WAVE2-REPORT.md) for
exact test scopes, source-freeze evidence, and the separate H2 acceptance record.

## Reproduction

Follow [the slice README](README.md) to refresh canonical rendering and regenerate
probes after source changes. Native compilation is explicit and serialized:

```bash
GNN_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/GeneralizedNotationNotation
uv run python specs/gnn-bridge-q7-continuous-ou-proof/verify_native.py --compile --gnn-root "$GNN_ROOT" --receipt output/bridge/q7-native-candidate.json
uv run python specs/gnn-bridge-q7-continuous-ou-proof/verify_native.py --check --gnn-root "$GNN_ROOT" --receipt output/bridge/q7-native-candidate.json
```

Use a fresh candidate path per capture and check that same candidate against
the same named GNN root; never overwrite the historical native JSON.
Default and `--check` validation are read-only. A source, contract, artifact,
import, or toolchain change invalidates the corresponding receipt. Content
custody assumes trusted local Python and toolchain binaries; it is not a sandbox
or independent host/compiler authentication. Publication and provider-backed
execution retain their separate acceptance requirements.
